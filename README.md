# Who am I ? 
Hey, I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in backend development. I spent two years at the French IT Epitech school before continuing my journey as a self-taught developer. My primary focus is on building efficient and well-structured backend systems, but I occasionally explore other areas of software development.

### Summary  
I'm a backend-focused developer with a passion for learning and problem-solving. While I specialize in Node.js, I enjoy experimenting with different languages and frameworks to broaden my knowledge.  
Unfortunately, 90% of my projects are not displayed here due to contracts and affiliations with companies or other entities. On this account, you'll only find 'fun' projects developed purely for enjoyment!
